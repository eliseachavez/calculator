Lessons Learned

 - Description of the problem: css layers hidden and alignment off
    Solution: Started at the beginning. Made the parent boxes and didn't
    move to children boxes until those looked right. And so on.
    Saved any and all alignment for later. Used padding and margin attributes
    on children boxes in order to still be able to see the parent layers.
    Once all these were working, I was able to work with the elements. I simply
    needed to have working parent boxes first. I can treat the elements
    exactly like children flex items.
    Many of my issues also went back to very small errors, like forgetting a
    semicolon and an end brace.
